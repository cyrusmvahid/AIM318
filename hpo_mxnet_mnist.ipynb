    "This example notebook focuses on how to create a convolutional neural network model to train the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) using MXNet distributed training. It leverages SageMaker's hyperparameter tuning to kick off multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter combinations, to find the set with best model performance.  This is an important step in the machine learning process as hyperparameter settings can have a large impact on model accuracy.  In this example, we'll use the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) to create a hyperparameter tuning job for an MXNet estimator.\n",

Note, if a role not associated with the current notebook instance, or more than one role is required for training and/or hosting, please replace `sagemaker.get_execution_role()` with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."
